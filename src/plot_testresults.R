#Fourth script#


# take two arguments: a path/filename pointing to the data, and
# a path/filename prefix where to write the figure(s)/table(s) to and what to call it (e.g., results/this_analysis)

# TBD: proportion of the top 100 in each group
# alternatively (sample or 10 discussed in proposal), or weighting by rank


# reads the output of the first and/or third script, generate some summary/final result table(s) and/or figure(s) 


# save summary/final result table(s) and/or figure(s)  to files.
