## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading data}

top_tracks <- read_csv("/Users/seiryu8808/Desktop/DSCI522_Pall-v_sedv8808/data/top-tracks-of-2017.csv")
daily_ranking <- read_csv("/Users/seiryu8808/Desktop/DSCI522_Pall-v_sedv8808/data/spotify-worldwide-daily-song-ranking.csv")

```



```{r making summary for daily ranking}

colnames(daily_ranking)[2] <- "track_name"

daily_ranking %>%
 # filter(Region == "ca") %>%
  select(track_name, Artist, Streams, URL) %>%
  group_by(track_name, URL) %>%
  summarise(Streams = sum(Streams)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Streams))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
